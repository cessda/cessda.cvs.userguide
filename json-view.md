You can also view the study description in JSON format, by clicking on 'View JSON'.
How it appears depends on the browser you are using.
Currently only Firefox displays JSON in structured format natively.
For other browsers, you need to install a JSON formatter extension if you do not want to see unformatted JSON.

This is the JSON view in Safari, without a JSON formatting extension.
