Known issues
============

(As of August 6, 2019)

* The User Interface only displays records for which descriptions are available in the selected UI language.
  So the message shown towards the top left hand side e.g. '21460 results found' refers to the selected language only,
  and not the total number of available records.
  There may be records for which descriptions are only available in other languagues.
  *The language of the data files is independent from this.*

* Not all UI languages have any records available to search/view in that language,
  so have been temporarily removed from the UI language menu, and hence cannot be selected (currently cs, de, et, fr, hu, it, pt, sr).
  Therefore these languages currently use the English "cmmstudy_en" index.
  When metadata is available in any of these languages, new indices should be created.

* Not all UI languages have a corresponding UI translation (currently cs, da, et, hu, it, nl, pt, sr),
  so the labels appear in English (if the language is selectable, see above).
